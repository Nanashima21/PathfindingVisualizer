# Pathfinding Visualizer (Tentative)

Web app for visualizing a bunch of different generating maze and pathfinding algorithms.

You can play from [here](https://nanashima21.github.io/PathfindingVisualizer/).

There are two elements: Single Grid, Compare Pathfinding

Single Grid : Just Pathfinding.

Compare Pathfinding : Two types of pathfindings can be performed and compared at the same time.

note : Changing window size during sorting may result in incorrect generating maze and pathfinding.
